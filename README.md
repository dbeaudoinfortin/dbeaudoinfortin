## Howdy ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Principal Software Engineer at [8x8](https://github.com/8x8). I primarily spend my time with backend languages like Java, C, C++, C#, Visual Basic, x86 assembly, and SQL on both Windows and Linux. I have a background in Computer Science, and I'm passionate about computer hardware, software and all types of technology.

## What am I working on these days?

I recently started the :maple_leaf:[NAPS Data Analysis Toolbox](https://github.com/dbeaudoinfortin/NAPSDataAnalysis). My goal with this project is to help researchers study historical Canadian air pollution data. If you have any suggestions on how I can best achieve that goal, I'd love to hear them!

In the next few weeks, I plan to spin off my ðŸŽ¨[heat map generation]() code into its own library so that anyone can benefit from it. The goal is to make it really easy for anyone to create beautiful custom heat maps in only a few lines of Java code. Coming soon!

If you are interested in a small, practical Java utility, check out the :page_facing_up:[StackTraceCompactor](https://github.com/dbeaudoinfortin/StackTraceCompactor), which can help you reduce the verbosity of Java stack traces without sacrificing information.
