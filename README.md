## Howdy ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Principal Software Engineer at [8x8](https://github.com/8x8). I primarily spend my time with backend languages like Java, C, C++, C#, Visual Basic, x86 assembly, and SQL on both Windows and Linux. I have a background in Computer Science, and I'm passionate about computer hardware, software, and all types of technology.

## What am I working on these days?

I recently started the :maple_leaf:[NAPS Data Analysis Toolbox](https://github.com/dbeaudoinfortin/NAPSDataAnalysis). Check out the [data download webpage](https://dbeaudoinfortin.github.io/NAPSDataAnalysis/). My goal with this project is to help researchers study historical Canadian air pollution data. If you have any suggestions for how I can best achieve that goal, I'd love to hear them!

I've created an :iphone:[Android app](https://github.com/dbeaudoinfortin/AQHICanadaApp) that keeps you informed about your local Canadian Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) in real-time! The app includes widgets and allow you to view current, historical, forecasted, and typical AQHI readings for your area, or anywhere in Canada. It's now complete and available for download and installation from the [releases section](https://github.com/dbeaudoinfortin/AQHICanadaApp/releases).

Check out my ðŸŽ¨[heat map generation library](https://github.com/dbeaudoinfortin/HeatMaps). The goal is to make it really easy for anyone to create beautiful custom heat maps with just a few lines of Java code. The code is simple, stable and there is lots of documentation to help you get started.

If you are interested in a small, practical Java utility, check out the :page_facing_up:[StackTraceCompactor](https://github.com/dbeaudoinfortin/StackTraceCompactor), which can help you reduce the verbosity of Java stack traces without sacrificing information.
